# matterport_test
Unity test of Matterport mesh w first person controller 
All I did was download the obj file from Matterport, import it and its contents into Unity, set up first person character, pop on mesh colliders, fiddle with the scale of the character controller and the step speed and size for scale, and build out to Web GL.
